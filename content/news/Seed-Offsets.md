# Monero mnemonic seed with offset passphrase
#### UPDATE Feather and Monerujo wallets
\
\
Now it's even easier to use and store multiple mnemonic seeds!

Head to 'Restore Wallet', enter your seed and then a passphrase. Passphrases which you can freely choose, offset your seed and create new and unique mnemonics.

If someone finds your seed and they restore, they'll end up with nothing.

Only if they find both seed + offset they can restore the right wallets :)
